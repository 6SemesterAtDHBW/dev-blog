Based on this, we assigned tasks that align with their areas of expertise, ensuring everyone has a role that plays to their strengths.</p><p id="z8tpcft_21">The weekly workload varies depending on the tasks at hand. While we try to keep it balanced, the nature of the tasks may cause this to not always be possible. However, we've agreed that each team member should have something to work on each week, and even if time is limited, there will be a minimum level of contribution.</p><p id="z8tpcft_22">This way, the amount of time spent on the project should balance out over the course of the project.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="progress-this-week" data-toc="progress-this-week">Progress this week</h2><p id="z8tpcft_23">After a bumpy start with our version control system, we managed to get everything up and running. Initially, we decided to use Git(hub) for version control, but we quickly realized that it was not the right tool for Game Development projects. To solve this issue, we switched to Perforce, which is a much better fit for our needs.</p><p id="z8tpcft_24">We also set up our project management tool Jira and started planning our project and created some tasks.</p><p id="z8tpcft_25">Once we were ready to work on the game, we started by creating a basic map layout with procedural generation of a simple hallway, together with a starter room.</p><figure id="z8tpcft_26"><img alt="Hallway.png" src="images/Hallway.png" title="Hallway.png" width="2038" height="1144"></figure><p id="z8tpcft_27">The hallway is procedurally generated and will be the main part of the game. The player will have to navigate through these hallways, we are however unsure about the final goal and layout. <br> The rooms are currently still missing, but we added some sound effects and flickering lights:</p><div class="video-player" id="z8tpcft_28"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="560" height="315" data-theme="light" data="images/Flickering-Lamps.mp4"></object></div><p id="z8tpcft_29">The lamps in the hallway are flickering, which adds to the horror atmosphere of the game. They also have sound effects, with a constant buzzing sound, and a different sound effect when they flicker. They are also less bright than the lamps in the starter room, which makes some parts of the hallway quite dark.</p><figure id="z8tpcft_30"><img alt="Starter-Room.png" src="images/Starter-Room.png" title="Starter-Room.png" width="2038" height="1144"></figure><p id="z8tpcft_31">The starter room contains some brighter lights that enlightens the room with the two elevator doors, the player will be able to go into them in a future version.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="time-spent" data-toc="time-spent">Time spent</h2><figure id="z8tpcft_33"><img alt="Timesheet-W1.png" src="images/Timesheet-W1.png" title="Timesheet-W1.png" width="2302" height="518"></figure></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 03 May 2025</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="development-blog.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Development Blog</a><a href="week-02.html" class="navigation-links__next">Week 02</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b518/app.js"></script></body></html>
