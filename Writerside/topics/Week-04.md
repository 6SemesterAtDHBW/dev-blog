## Game Analytics

### Introduction
Game analytics is an essential tool for analyzing and improving player experiences. 
This concept outlines the collection and utilization of game data in a horror game developed with Unreal Engine 5, 
focusing on player interactions, emotions, and game progress.

### Objectives of Game Analysis

- Analysis of player behaviour (movement patterns, interactions, game dropouts)
- Examination of stress and fear reactions
- Identification of balancing issues and difficulty levels
- Evaluation of cooperative elements in multiplayer gameplay

### Data Collection

The collection of game data is carried out through various mechanisms within Unreal Engine 5:

#### In-Game Telemetry
- Movement Data (Player position, movement paths, time spent in specific areas)
- Interaction Data (Use of objects, trigger activations)
- Latency Times (Reaction times to jump scares or threats)
- Task Completion (Time taken to complete tasks, success/failure rates, cooperative vs solo task attempts)

### Biometric Data (Just Concept)
- Heart rate measurement (via external devices such as smartwatches or ECG sensors)
- Eye-tracking for analyzing gaze movements
- Facial Expression Analysis (Using webcam-based AI to detect expressions related to fear, surprise, or stress during intense gameplay moments)
- Voice Stress Analysis (Evaluating voice pitch and tremors during player communication to determine emotional states)
- Muscle Tension Detection (Capturing involuntary muscle reactions, particularly in the face and hands, to detect subconscious fear responses)

### Questionaries and Player Feedback
- Subjective assessments through questionnaires after a game session
- Direct feedback on specific game events

## Technical Implementation in Unreal Engine 5

### Data Logging
- Use of the Unreal Insights analytics platform for real-time monitoring
- Multiplayer event tracking to analyze cooperation and competition dynamics

### Visualization and Analysis
- Heatmaps to represent player movements
- Statistical Analyses to identify trends and patterns
- Player Interaction Metrics to assess teamwork and individual decision-making
- Biometric Data Correlation to map physiological responses to in-game events for improved horror mechanics design

##  Data Protection and Ethical Considerations
- Anonymization of data to protect privacy
- Player consent for data collection in accordance with GDPR
- Transparency by providing access rights to players
