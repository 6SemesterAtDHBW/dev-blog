### Sounds

For the right choice of sounds, suitable free sounds were searched for on the Internet. 
An extensive search was carried out to find the right sound for the game. 
These sounds were then edited again with FL Studio to better adapt the sounds to the game and create a unique modified sound.

Example for a provider of free sounds:

### Assets

Via the FAB marketplace, we have been looking for matching 3D models, which serve as decoration of the environment.
We have selected various decorative elements such as blackboards, projectors, tables, chairs and many other elements which can be added to the room in the next steps.

The following image shows the FAB Marketplace:
