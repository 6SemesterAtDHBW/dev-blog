# Week 05

## Progress this week

### Level Design

This week the full gameplay was added to the game. The player now needs to collect the exam results while a counter counts these. If enough are collected, then the player can advance to the next level. 

### Flashlight

We added a toggleable flashlight to the game. The flashlight can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map.
We did this by adding a spotlight to the first person character, of which the visibility is toggled when pressing the button.
Here's an example of the flashlight in action:

### Bug Fixes

The AI now moves to all the classrooms via Nav Links and Nav Meshes. This allows the AI to move around the map freely.

Sound for the opening and closing of the classroom doors has been added.

Unused Code has been removed from the project, for example, handling items and unused AI movements.

### AI Character

The AI now uses Keiji, a Meta-human representing a professor at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

### New Screens

An End- and Win-screen have been added. These bring the player back to the main menu after finishing the game.

### How to play the game?

The game is a horror game, with a Backrooms style, that takes place inside a place that looks similar to the DHBW Karlsruhe. The player has to navigate through the hallways and rooms of the DHBW Karlsruhe, while avoiding the AI character.
The player needs to collect all the exam results while avoiding the AI enemy and not letting the timer run out. 
A flashlight is available to the player, which can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map.

### Game Analytics Results

After we implemented in the last weeks a lot of Game Analytics stuff about player movement, their behaviour, how long the played the game and tract it, we got a lot of information.
Although is was hard to get some relevant information about the game, so next to the automatic gathered informationen, we decided to create a short survey, that some of the players we had answered.
In the following we will take a close look at the result.

The Game Analytics can be found here: [Game Analytics Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdEUNNCy_0wgqCvU4rtCanIiAk_hENHWrA5E779QGnzwgS8g/viewform?usp=header)

So we got there quite more data then from the Ingame Analytics, so we will take that data to make short review.
It looks like we developed a quite good game, where one of the most impressive parts seems to be the map, where we also had a big focus on and spent a lot of time detailing it.
In addition with our newly added AI character, we gave the player quite a scary feeling with the ambient. So the main part for an horror game is done.
Still the gameplay needs some improvement, as it should be more challenging and varied. Especially the multiplayer should have more elements to it, as already described in previous dev blogs.
All in all a good game that needs defintly some adjustments and detailing to make it more fun to play.

### Upcoming tasks
In addition to the feedback and our ideas about the game we have a short list of things we want to do in the next week:
- Add more details to the map
- Add the whole DHBW building
- Add more characters and a character selector where the player can chose from
- Improve AI behaviour
- Add more game mechanics, such as multiplayer only (need two or more players)
- Add more easter eggs, to make the map more interesting
