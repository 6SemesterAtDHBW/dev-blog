# Week 05

## Progress this week

### Level Design

This week the full gameplay was added to the game. The player now needs to collect the exam results while a counter counts these. If enough are collected, then the player can advance to the next level. 

### Flashlight

We added a toggleable flashlight to the game. The flashlight can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map.
We did this by adding a spotlight to the first person character, of which the visibility is toggled when pressing the button.
Here's an example of the flashlight in action:

### Bug Fixes

The AI now moves to all the classrooms via Nav Links and Nav Meshes. This allows the AI to move around the map freely.

Sound for the opening and closing of the classroom doors has been added.

Unused Code have been removed from the project for example handling items and unused AI movements.

### AI Character

The AI now uses Keiji, a Meta-human representing a professor at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

### New Screens

An End- and Win-screen have been added. These bring the player back to the main menu after finishing the game.

### How to play the game?

The game is a horror game, with a Backrooms style, that takes place inside a place that looks similar to the DHBW Karlsruhe. The player has to navigate through the hallways and rooms of the DHBW Karlsruhe, while avoiding the AI character.
The player needs to collect all the exam results while avoiding the AI enemy and not letting the timer run out. 
A flashlight is available to the player, which can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map.
