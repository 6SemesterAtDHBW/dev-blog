# Week 02

This week, we created new sounds and added new functionality to our game.

## New Technology used this week

- [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/)
- Blender (Modification of some static meshes)

## Progress this week

This week, we downloaded some sounds and modified them using FL Studio. We added filters and other modifications, to create a unique sound for the game.

Once we had modified the sounds, we integrated them into the game. Of course, the sounds are not yet perfect at this stage of the project.
They will still be improved so that they feel natural when playing.
