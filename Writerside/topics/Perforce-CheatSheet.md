On the left side you will see the file tree either of an depot or an selected workspace, called **Tree** pane.

While on the right side you can see stuff like the changelist or and Stream Graph. Next to the tab list there is an + icon where views can be added if you missing some.


Its important to know those three areas as they are mentioned in the following steps.
