# Week 01

## The Game

Our idea was to depict the DHBW Karlsruhe in the exact same way us students see it when the exams are near.
The game is a horror game, with a Backrooms style, that takes place inside a place that looks similar to the DHBW
Karlsruhe.

## Technology used

- Unreal Engine 5
- [Perforce / Helix Core](https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core) as Version Control
- [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) for this blog
- Jira for project management
- Discord for communication and regular meetings

## Progress this week

After a bumpy start with our version control system, we managed to get everything up and running.
Initially, we decided to use Git(hub) for version control, but we quickly realized that it was not the right tool for
Game Development projects. To solve this issue, we switched to Perforce, which is a much better fit for our needs.

We also set up our project management tool Jira and started planning our project and created some tasks.

Once we were ready to work on the game, we started by creating a basic map layout with procedural generation of a simple
hallway, together with a tutorial room.
