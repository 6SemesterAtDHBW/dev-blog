broad concept of what is possible and what would be an optimal solution for our game. Still, we needed to first implement a basic version of the game analytics before we go into detail. For that we looked out for solutions, and there were a lot, especially if you are willing to pay. But we preferred a free solution that isn't the default Unreal Engine 5 Insights, which is good but lacks some functionalities. So we decided for GameAnalytics.com, which is free for small teams and was quite easy to integrate. Right of the box, it offers a lot of functionalities, like it shows the current users playing, sending errors to it, and so on. That all is visible in a web-panel that looks like this:</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_55"><img alt="GameAnalyticsWebPanel.png" src="images/GameAnalyticsWebPanel.png" title="GameAnalyticsWebPanel.png" width="1515" height="585"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_56">In that example we only have an example of some stats, in specific, the Realtime Stats of our game. Next up we decided to log some events, getting information about how the player interacts while playing the game. Therefore, we created a new function to send the events to the GameAnalytics API.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_57"><img alt="GAnalyticsFunction.png" src="images/AnalyticsFunction.png" title="GAnalyticsFunction.png" width="935" height="354"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_58">In specific, we send an Event ID paired for some optional information, at the moment only, for example, for a player picking up or dropping items, starting the game. There is definitely more to follow, but we wanted to get a basic version up and running to test it. Now, to see the events in the web-panel, we need to start the game and play it for a bit. After that we can open the section Live Events in the panel, which looks like that.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_59"><img alt="LiveEvents.png" src="images/LiveEvents.png" title="LiveEvents.png" width="1203" height="829"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_60">You can see an overview over every event that happened that was logged in the game. To look at one specific event, we took an Item Drop event</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_61"><img alt="Event.png" src="images/Event.png" title="Event.png" width="1201" height="96"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_62">There is a lot of information from the OS the player is playing on till the language and actual event. Looking at the end of the first line, you can see there the event_id which says Item:Drop. All other events were also successfully logged and can be seen in the web-panel.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="progress-this-week" data-toc="progress-this-week">Progress this week</h2><p id="z8tr9ee_63">This week we have been mostly working on the main map like classrooms and hallways as well as on implementing voiceChat for multiplayer.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="improved-main-map-with-new-assets" data-toc="improved-main-map-with-new-assets">Improved Main Map with new Assets</h3><p id="z8tr9ee_67">Firstly, there are now many new custom-made assets in the game, which are used to decorate the map. We have added many new props like tables, chairs, whiteboards, and other props to make the map look more like the DHBW.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_68"><img alt="assets.png" src="images/assets.png" title="assets.png" width="1388" height="978"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_69">To improve the map building, walls, floors, and ceilings were created in a modular way. This means that the walls, floors, and ceilings are made up of several parts, which can be combined with each other. This allows us to create a more realistic map and also to create new rooms faster. Almost all the assets come in 1 meter, 2 meters, 5 meters, and 10-meter sizes, so that we can create a room of any size.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_70"><img alt="modular_assets.png" src="images/modular_assets.png" title="modular_assets.png" width="1212" height="985"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_71">Also created were different windows and doors to complete the hallways and rooms.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_72"><img alt="modular_assets_2.png" src="images/modular_assets_2.png" title="modular_assets_2.png" width="1131" height="617"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_73">These modular assets where used to build parts of the hallway and rooms.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_74"><img alt="modular_hallways.png" src="images/modular_hallways.png" title="modular_hallways.png" width="1065" height="771"></figure><figure id="z8tr9ee_75"><img alt="room.png" src="images/room.png" title="room.png" width="1033" height="807"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_76">But to create the map even faster, everything was built with <code class="code" id="z8tr9ee_79">Procedural Content Generation</code>. Specific points are created along a spline, which are then replaced with all the assets. This allows us to make the hallway as long as we want and create everything fast.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_77"><img alt="pcg_hallway.png" src="images/pcg_hallway.png" title="pcg_hallway.png" width="1054" height="776"></figure><figure id="z8tr9ee_78"><img alt="pcg_room.png" src="images/pcg_room.png" title="pcg_room.png" width="1689" height="779"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="starter-room" data-toc="starter-room">Starter Room</h3><p id="z8tr9ee_80">We also implemented the final version of our starter room, which took up enough time by now. We took inspiration from some images we took while we were at the DHBW.</p><p id="z8tr9ee_81">In this first image, you can see the area near the elevators, with some posters that resemble the actual area at the DHBW.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_82"><img alt="Starter room hallway ingame" src="images/Starter-Room-Hallway-Ingame.png" title="Starter room hallway ingame" width="2560" height="1282"></figure><figure id="z8tr9ee_83"><img alt="Starter room hallway" src="images/Starter-Room-Hallway.jpg" title="Starter room hallway" width="2048" height="1536"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_84">While most of the DHBW is modeled as closely as possible, we haven't added a staircase yet, which is why the door visible in the screenshot below is barely visible.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_85"><img alt="Elevator staircase ingame" src="images/Elevator-Staircase-Ingame.png" title="Elevator staircase ingame" width="2560" height="1282"></figure><figure id="z8tr9ee_86"><img alt="Elevator staircase" src="images/Elevator-Staircase.jpg" title="Elevator staircase" width="1536" height="2048"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="end-room" data-toc="end-room">End Room</h3><p id="z8tr9ee_87">We also added the door to the balcony and the escape staircase that is present in our reference footage.

The timer is displayed at the top of the screen and counts down from 10 minutes.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_97"><img alt="timer" src="images/timer.png" title="timer" width="381" height="88"></figure><section class="chapter"><h3 id="voicechat" data-toc="voicechat">VoiceChat</h3><p id="z8tr9ee_99">To further improve upon the multiplayer aspect, voice chat was introduced. This is currently in its early stages and has some issues with the audio quality as well as selecting the right audio device. We use Steam's inbuilt <code class="code" id="z8tr9ee_100">VOIP</code>-feature for Unreal Engine, though this has its limitations as mentioned.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="ai-enemy" data-toc="ai-enemy">AI Enemy</h2><p id="z8tr9ee_101">To make the game more interactive, we have decided to integrate an AI Enemy that follows the player as soon as it sees him. As long as the player is not in sight, the enemy randomly patrols the game world. For this behavior, a playable character was first created, which was assigned different movement speeds (e.g., walking and running). On this basis, an AI opponent was designed that monitors its surroundings using a pawn sensing system. If the opponent detects the player using this system (e.g., by sight), a reaction chain is triggered.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_102"><img alt="AI-Enemy-Event-Graph.png" src="images/AI-Enemy-Event-Graph.png" title="AI-Enemy-Event-Graph.png" width="1145" height="574"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_103">The underlying logic was implemented entirely using blueprints. Two main behaviors are used:</p><ol class="list _decimal" id="z8tr9ee_104" type="1"><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_106"><p>In the beginning, a user-defined &ldquo;MoveToRandomLocation&rdquo; event is called in the &ldquo;BeginPlay&rdquo; event. This retrieves a random location around the opponent via &ldquo;Get Random Location in Navigable Radius&rdquo; and transfers it to the &ldquo;AI MoveTo&rdquo; node, causing the opponent to move to the new position. Once the target is reached, the patrol event is called again, creating an infinite loop.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_107"><p>When the player is recognized via &ldquo;On See Pawn&rdquo; a sequence is started: </p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tr9ee_109"><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_110"><p>First, the opponent plays a certain animation (e.g., change to fighting or running stance).</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_111"><p>Then the movement speed is set to a higher value (e.g., 500) with &ldquo;Set Max Walk Speed&rdquo; to initiate the race.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_112"><p>This is followed by the &ldquo;AI MoveTo&rdquo; command, with which the opponent actively pursues the player.</p></li></ul></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_108"><p>After a delay (e.g., 2 seconds), a reset logic is executed: </p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tr9ee_113"><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_114"><p>A new animation is played (e.g., back to idle or normal running).</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_115"><p>The movement speed is reduced again (e.g., to 250).</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tr9ee_116"><p>The opponent is then reset to patrol mode. This behavior ensures a dynamic AI that reacts to the player's presence and adapts accordingly. The animations (e.g. &ldquo;Run&rdquo;, &ldquo;Idle&rdquo;, &lsquo;Walk&rsquo;) are set manually in the blueprint using the &ldquo;Play Animation&rdquo; node, depending on the situation. This combination of random movement, visual recognition, and targeted behavior makes the AI appear credible and interactive, which noticeably enhances the gameplay.</p></li></ul></li></ol><figure id="z8tr9ee_105"><img alt="AI-Enemy-Model.png" src="images/AI-Enemy-Model.png" title="AI-Enemy-Model.png" width="472" height="549"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="main-menu" data-toc="main-menu">Main Menu</h2><p id="z8tr9ee_117">The main menu was till now only there for pure functionality, which is also the main reason for it in any game. Still, we decided to give it a new fresh UI to make it feel more integrated into the game. A screenshot of it is shown below.</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_118"><img alt="mainMenu.png" src="images/mainMenu.png" title="mainMenu.png" width="1092" height="625"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_119">As you may recognize, we took a screenshot of the DHBW App Students use to see their current grades and calendar. On top of it, we reworked the sidebar and added buttons which are used to navigate through the main menu and start a game should it be singleplayer or multiplayer. The image above only shows the Main Menu, but every other menu we have ingame was also reworked. It's not necessary to go through each in detail, but for completeness we will show the other menus below.</p><p id="z8tr9ee_120">We also changed the server list, the &quot;create server&quot; page to have the same style:</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_121"><img alt="serverList.png" src="images/serverList.png" title="serverList.png" width="1088" height="624"></figure><figure id="z8tr9ee_122"><img alt="createServer.png" src="images/createServer.png" title="createServer.png" width="1088" height="625"></figure><p id="z8tr9ee_123">We also added a menu that shows up when you pause the game:</p><figure id="z8tr9ee_124"><img alt="ingamePauseMenu.png" src="images/ingamePauseMenu.png" title="ingamePauseMenu.png" width="348" height="535"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="time-spent" data-toc="time-spent">Time spent</h2><figure id="z8tr9ee_125"><img alt="Timesheet-W4.png" src="images/Timesheet-W4.png" title="Timesheet-W4.png" width="1996" height="531"></figure></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 03 May 2025</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="week-03.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Week 03</a><a href="week-05.html" class="navigation-links__next">Week 05</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b518/app.js"></script></body></html>
