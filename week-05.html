The flashlight can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map. We did this by adding a spotlight to the first person character, of which the visibility is toggled when pressing the button. Here's an example of the flashlight in action:</p><figure id="z8trwdx_17"><img alt="Flashlight.png" src="images/Flashlight.png" title="Flashlight.png" width="1240" height="699"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="bug-fixes" data-toc="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3><p id="z8trwdx_18">The AI now moves to all the classrooms via Nav Links and Nav Meshes.

The player has to navigate through the hallways and rooms of the DHBW Karlsruhe, while avoiding the AI character. The player needs to collect all the exam results while avoiding the AI enemy and not letting the timer run out. A flashlight is available to the player, which can be used to illuminate the dark areas of the map.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="game-analytics-results" data-toc="game-analytics-results">Game Analytics Results</h3><p id="z8trwdx_24">After we implemented in the last weeks a lot of Game Analytics stuff about player movement, their behaviour, how long the played the game and tract it, we got a lot of information. Although is was hard to get some relevant information about the game, so next to the automatic gathered informationen, we decided to create a short survey, that some of the players we had answered. In the following we will take a close look at the result.</p><p id="z8trwdx_25">The Game Analytics can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdEUNNCy_0wgqCvU4rtCanIiAk_hENHWrA5E779QGnzwgS8g/viewform?usp=header" id="z8trwdx_27" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Analytics Survey</a></p><section class="chapter"><h4 id="question-result" data-toc="question-result">Question Result</h4><p id="z8trwdx_28"><figure id="z8trwdx_30"><img alt="survey1.png" src="images/survey1.png" title="survey1.png" width="766" height="726"></figure><figure id="z8trwdx_31"><img alt="survey2.png" src="images/survey2.png" title="survey2.png" width="764" height="724"></figure><figure id="z8trwdx_32"><img alt="survey3.png" src="images/survey3.png" title="survey3.png" width="773" height="686"></figure><figure id="z8trwdx_33"><img alt="survey4.png" src="images/survey4.png" title="survey4.png" width="777" height="764"></figure><figure id="z8trwdx_34"><img alt="survey5.png" src="images/survey5.png" title="survey5.png" width="785" height="627"></figure><figure id="z8trwdx_35"><img alt="survey6.png" src="images/survey6.png" title="survey6.png" width="788" height="394"></figure></p><p id="z8trwdx_29">So we got there quite more data then from the Ingame Analytics, so we will take that data to make short review. It looks like we developed a quite good game, where one of the most impressive parts seems to be the map, where we also had a big focus on and spent a lot of time detailing it. In addition with our newly added AI character, we gave the player quite a scary feeling with the ambient. So the main part for an horror game is done. Still the gameplay needs some improvement, as it should be more challenging and varied. Especially the multiplayer should have more elements to it, as already described in previous dev blogs. All in all a good game that needs defintly some adjustments and detailing to make it more fun to play.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="upcoming-tasks" data-toc="upcoming-tasks">Upcoming tasks</h3><p id="z8trwdx_36">In addition to the feedback and our ideas about the game we have a short list of things we want to do in the next week:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8trwdx_37"><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_38"><p>Add more details to the map</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_39"><p>Add the whole DHBW building</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_40"><p>Add more characters and a character selector where the player can chose from</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_41"><p>Improve AI behaviour</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_42"><p>Add more game mechanics, such as multiplayer only (need two or more players)</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8trwdx_43"><p>Add more easter eggs, to make the map more interesting</p></li></ul></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="time-spent" data-toc="time-spent">Time spent</h2><figure id="z8trwdx_44"><img alt="Timesheet-W5.png" src="images/Timesheet-W5.png" title="Timesheet-W5.png" width="1389" height="515"></figure></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 03 May 2025</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="week-04.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Week 04</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b518/app.js"></script></body></html>
