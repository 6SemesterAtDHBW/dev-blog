Although the input we got was mainly focused on Unity, we still got some relevant stuff to present. So the main different is clearly that in Unity the logic is gets written in C, while in UnrealEngine we can use such things as blueprints. Although there is C++ code and classes available in most cases its not used. As all the functionalities are covered in Blueprints.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="project-structure" data-toc="project-structure">Project Structure</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_15">To start with the basics our project structure looks like this.</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_16"><img alt="projectStructure.png" src="images/projectStructure.png" title="projectStructure.png" width="794" height="860"></figure><p id="z8tpzfc_17">Thats the vary basics but still relevant so we all know were to find certain models and blueprints.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="perforce-helixcore-setup" data-toc="perforce-helixcore-setup">Perforce HelixCore Setup</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_18">As we use Perforce HelixCore as Version Control System we setup up some Streams in git known as branches, so we all can code at the same time without creating much conflicts.</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_19"><img alt="perforce_streams.png" src="images/perforce_streams.png" title="perforce_streams.png" width="1012" height="378"></figure><p id="z8tpzfc_20">Its a very basic concept of streams, a main stream and for each dev and own stream.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="coding-blueprints" data-toc="coding-blueprints">Coding / Blueprints</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_21">As already mentioned in UnrealEngine there is no real coding and classes as their blueprints. So widely know concepts in architecture cant be used directly. Still in Blueprints there also exists stuff like Inheritance, which is also one of the main part we will use. So an example for that would be that at the moment we have an upper class BP_FirstPersonCharacter, which handles all the logic but has like an template character used for development. To create multiple characters we could create parents of that class were we onl adjust the character and some animations details, but the logic is still handled, by the parent class. While that is an theoretical example, we can also present one we will defintly implement.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_22">So as we have items in the game that can be picked upped we will have a parent class to handle that.</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_23"><img alt="inheritance.png" src="images/inheritance.png" title="inheritance.png" width="972" height="412"></figure><p id="z8tpzfc_24">The parent class will have a mesh and a collision sphere, to handle the pickup, for each item in the game like a flashlight a child could be added were only the mesh must be updated. Additionally in the child there could be also an adjustment of parent settings or additions to functionalities as already known from the concept of inheritance.</p></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="progress-this-week" data-toc="progress-this-week">Progress this week</h2><p id="z8tpzfc_25">This week, we created new sounds, reworked the starter room and gave the elevator some animations. We also reworked a main menu that shows up when the game is started and added support for multiplayer through Steam.</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="sounds" data-toc="sounds">Sounds</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_30">First, we downloaded some sounds and modified them using FL Studio. We added filters and other modifications, to create a unique sound for the game.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_31">Once we had modified the sounds, we integrated them into the game. Of course, the sounds are not yet perfect at this stage of the project. They will still be improved so that they feel natural when playing.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_32">The following image is a Screenshot of the Mixing &amp; Filter area in FL Studio:</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_33"><img alt="FL_Studio.png" src="images/FL_Studio.png" title="FL_Studio.png" width="1106" height="737"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="elevator-animations" data-toc="elevator-animations">Elevator animations</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_34">We converted the elevator door into a blueprint and added a sliding animation to it. The elevator door now opens when the player stands inside the elevator.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_35">We also added a new spawn point inside the elevator, which means that the player now starts inside the elevator.</p><div class="video-player" id="z8tpzfc_36"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="560" height="315" data-theme="light" data="images/Elevator-Animation.mp4"></object></div></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="reworked-starter-room" data-toc="reworked-starter-room">Reworked Starter Room</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_37">As it was already possible to see in the video above, we added a mirror to the elevator. This was done to resemble the real-life elevator in the building where the game is set as close as possible.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_38">This came with the problem that the current starter room was invisible in the mirror. After a bit of debugging, we found out, that the Unreal Engine Box Brushes are sort of deprecated and won't render in the lighting system, which is possible to see in the Lumen overview mode. Due to this, we had to remake the whole room using static meshes inside the Modelling Editor.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_39">This wireframe shows the difference between the two rooms (top is old, bottom is new):</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_40"><img alt="Wireframe-Modelling.png" src="images/Wireframe-Modelling.png" title="Wireframe-Modelling.png" width="2038" height="1254"></figure><p id="z8tpzfc_41">After doing this, the mirror works flawlessly (and exposes that we were too lazy to add a player model):</p><div class="video-player" id="z8tpzfc_42"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="560" height="315" data-theme="light" data="images/Elevator-Mirror.mp4"></object></div><p id="z8tpzfc_43">The elevator is now fully functional and complete, we will however still change the layout of the room, as there is supposed to be a second elevator, as well as two hallways on the side of them.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="multiplayer-and-main-menu" data-toc="multiplayer-and-main-menu">Multiplayer and Main Menu</h3><p id="z8tpzfc_44">We have added the feature to play the game in multiplayer mode with your friends. These sample images and videos show what our multiplayer currently looks like.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_45">At the current state, the multiplayer can be shared with up to 4 people on one server.</p><p id="z8tpzfc_46">To join a server, we added a Main Menu with basic functionalities like creating a server, viewing a list of active servers, and joining a server.</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_47"><img alt="Main-Menu-W2.png" src="images/Main-Menu-W2.png" title="Main-Menu-W2.png" width="1037" height="750"></figure><figure id="z8tpzfc_48"><img alt="Server-List-W2.png" src="images/Server-List-W2.png" title="Server-List-W2.png" width="1275" height="653"></figure><figure id="z8tpzfc_49"><img alt="Create-Server-W2.png" src="images/Create-Server-W2.png" title="Create-Server-W2.png" width="705" height="585"></figure><p id="z8tpzfc_50">We also played around a bit in the game and took some screenshots and videos of the multiplayer mode, since we wanted to share how even just running around with friends can be fun:</p><figure id="z8tpzfc_51"><img alt="Multiplayer-Demo-1.jpg" src="images/Multiplayer-Demo-1.jpg" title="Multiplayer-Demo-1.jpg" width="2560" height="1440"></figure><div class="video-player" id="z8tpzfc_52"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="560" height="315" data-theme="light" data="images/Multiplayer-Demo-Video.mp4"></object></div></section></section><section class="chapter"><h2 id="time-spent" data-toc="time-spent">Time spent</h2><figure id="z8tpzfc_53"><img alt="Timesheet-W2.png" src="images/Timesheet-W2.png" title="Timesheet-W2.png" width="2302" height="526"></figure></section><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 03 May 2025</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="week-01.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Week 01</a><a href="week-03.html" class="navigation-links__next">Week 03</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.10.0-b518/app.js"></script></body></html>
