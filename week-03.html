Especially what kind of addictive pattern we will have in our game and how we implement them. Basically they can be divided in the categories Create, Collobarate, Compete and Explore. For each game the categories have an different impact and a different weight. The thoughts we made for each category are summarized below:</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="create" data-toc="create">Create</h3><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_11"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_12"><p>Character Selector</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="collobarate" data-toc="collobarate">Collobarate</h3><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_13"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_14"><p>Multiplayer with Friends</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_15"><p>Multiplayer only actions or locations, you need to be together to find certain places or do certain actions</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="compete" data-toc="compete">Compete</h3><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_16"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_17"><p>Achievements like Finish in Time, Fins Easter Eggs, Special Items</p></li></ul></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="explore" data-toc="explore">Explore</h3><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_18"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_20"><p>Unique Map</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_21"><p>Find special places, Easter Eggs, hidden content</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_22"><p>Find items</p></li></ul><p id="z8tqmev_19">Some of the points are already implemented, some are still in the planning phase.

We also further improved the movement system, added new animations and improved the camera effects. ...</p><section class="chapter"><h3 id="improved-starter-room" data-toc="improved-starter-room">Improved Starter Room</h3><p id="z8tqmev_33">We improved the starter room further over the last week. The mirror in the last week had some issues with lighting - there were flickering dots flying around on all textures and no color was visible. After some information gathering, we found out that the issue was caused by the <code class="code" id="z8tqmev_41">Lumen</code> system for Global Illumination, which has some issues with reflections in the newest Unreal Engine version.</p><figure id="z8tqmev_34"><img alt="illumination-settings.png" src="images/illumination-settings.png" title="illumination-settings.png" width="432" height="249"></figure><p id="z8tqmev_35">To fix this, we changed to the newer <code class="code" id="z8tqmev_42">Screen Space</code> system for our First Person Camera. This comes with a few major improvements, even tho it is currently only in Beta. You can see a real difference:</p><div class="video-player" id="z8tqmev_36"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="2560" height="1440" data-theme="light" data="images/illumination-old.mp4"><param name="cover" value="images/illumination-old-thumbnail.png"></object></div><p id="z8tqmev_37">This is the old system. Not only are the flickering dots gone, but if you compare it to the new system, you can see a few more real improvements:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_38"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_43"><p>Textures are fully visible in the mirror</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_44"><p>The wall textures appear much more detailed</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_45"><p>The lighting is much more realistic, seeming a bit more dim</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_46"><p>If you look around, the effect of bending on the side of the mirror doesn't look as weird (in the old system, it looks as if that's not a reflection, but the real texture)</p></li></ul><div class="video-player" id="z8tqmev_39"><object class="article__bordered-element" width="2560" height="1440" data-theme="light" data="images/illumination-new.mp4"><param name="cover" value="images/illumination-new-thumbnail.png"></object></div><p id="z8tqmev_40">Together with this, we improve our lamps the make them invisible through walls if looked at through the mirror. We also changed the room layout a bit, so that the starter room resembles the room better.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="sounds" data-toc="sounds">Sounds</h3><p id="z8tqmev_47">For the right choice of sounds, suitable free sounds were searched for on the Internet. An extensive search was carried out to find the right sound for the game. These sounds were then edited again with FL Studio to better adapt the sounds to the game and create a unique modified sound.</p><p id="z8tqmev_48">Example for a provider of free sounds:</p><figure id="z8tqmev_49"><img alt="free_sounds_provider.png" src="images/free_sounds_provider.png" title="free_sounds_provider.png" width="1124" height="959"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="assets" data-toc="assets">Assets</h3><p id="z8tqmev_50">Via the FAB marketplace, we have been looking for matching 3D models, which serve as decoration of the environment. We have selected various decorative elements such as blackboards, projectors, tables, chairs and many other elements which can be added to the room in the next steps.</p><p id="z8tqmev_51">The following image shows the FAB Marketplace:</p><figure id="z8tqmev_52"><img alt="fab_marketplace.png" src="images/fab_marketplace.png" title="fab_marketplace.png" width="1384" height="991"></figure></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="movement-system" data-toc="movement-system">Movement System</h3><p id="z8tqmev_53">To make the game feel better we improved our movement system, so the players have a better feeling of their character. As well as in the multiplayer the other characters should look a bit familiar and not so static, so we also added their some animations. So we went through the following steps:</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="added-sprint-stamina" data-toc="added-sprint-stamina">Added Sprint Stamina</h3><p id="z8tqmev_54">In first place we adjusted the character movement by adjusting the walk speed, so the character won't automatically sprint. Instead, the sprint mode can be toggled by holding Shift down, also now if the character sprints he will lose stamina and regenerate if he is back walking or standing still. The current stamina gets displayed in a progressbar in the bottom left.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="improved-footsteps" data-toc="improved-footsteps">Improved Footsteps</h3><p id="z8tqmev_55">Last week we already added footsteps, which didn't sound quite good, so we improved them by not only taking on sound, instead we took 10 sounds which get automatically randomized due Unreal Engine Sound Cue Class.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="crouch" data-toc="crouch">Crouch</h3><p id="z8tqmev_56">Now we have already sprinting and walking, what's missing is crouching, for that we added a new animation, which let the player crouch. We added both an idle and walk animation for the crouch, which can be entered by holding down CTRL.</p><p id="z8tqmev_57">We found both of the animations here: https://www.mixamo.com/#/</p><section class="chapter"><h4 id="adding-more-animations" data-toc="adding-more-animations">Adding more animations</h4><p id="z8tqmev_60">In the last step we wanted to make the head movement of each player visible for that we made the whole upper body moveable so, also in the multiplayer all players can see which direction a player is currently looking at, making the game feel better.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h4 id="multiplayer" data-toc="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h4><p id="z8tqmev_61">We encountered through the steps some issue that the developed features were only visible to the client not to the other players. So we had to use an UnrealEngine concept that replicates everything to all others players. That's because UnrealEngine tries to reduce the packets that are send through the multiplayer. So we had to use the following concept for features like the body movement, when the player moves the camera and making the sprint animation visible to all.</p><p id="z8tqmev_62">Taking the sprint example it looks like this:</p><figure id="z8tqmev_63"><img alt="multiplayer_sync_example.png" src="images/multiplayer_sync_example.png" title="multiplayer_sync_example.png" width="625" height="424"></figure><p id="z8tqmev_64">So instead of just doing it on the client we call an RunOnServer_Sprint Event, which <span class="control" id="z8tqmev_68">replicates on the Server</span> and * <span class="emphasis" id="z8tqmev_69">MultiCast it to every Player</span>*.</p><figure id="z8tqmev_65"><img alt="multiplayer_sync_example_run-on-server.png" src="images/multiplayer_sync_example_run-on-server.png" title="multiplayer_sync_example_run-on-server.png" width="457" height="145"></figure><p id="z8tqmev_66">That happens through the call of the event MultiCast_Sprint, which Replicate Mode is set to <span class="control" id="z8tqmev_70">Multicast</span>.</p><figure id="z8tqmev_67"><img alt="multiplayer_sync_example_multicast.png" src="images/multiplayer_sync_example_multicast.png" title="multiplayer_sync_example_multicast.png" width="466" height="170"></figure></section></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="camera-effects" data-toc="camera-effects">Camera Effects</h3><p id="z8tqmev_71">To make the game more realistic and to give the player a better horror feeling of the game, we changed the following camera effects:</p><ul class="list _bullet" id="z8tqmev_72"><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_74"><p>Added a vignette effect to the camera, which darkens the edges of the screen and makes the center of the screen brighter,</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_75"><p>Added a chromatic aberration effect to the camera, which makes the colors of the screen look a bit distorted,</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_76"><p>Added a bloom effect to the camera, which makes the light sources in the game look a bit brighter and more realistic,</p></li><li class="list__item" id="z8tqmev_77"><p>Added a depth of field effect to the camera, which makes the objects in the background look a bit blurry and the objects in the foreground look a bit sharper,</p></li></ul><p id="z8tqmev_73">and many more smaller changes to the camera effect settings.</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="enemy-ai" data-toc="enemy-ai">Enemy AI</h3><p id="z8tqmev_78">We have added a new small enemy AI to the game, which is in the current state a simple enemy that follows the player if it is in a certain range.
